      <p>Welcome! My name is Andrés Montealegre, I am an incoming Software Engineering Intern at J.P. Morgan and current Software Engineer at NASA's Colorado Space Grant Consortium. Currently, I am expected to graduate in 2022 from the University of Colorado Boulder with studies in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and Global Engineering. Moreover, I am a part of several student groups including the University of Colorado Men's Soccer, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, Google Student Developer Club, and the LEEDS Investment and Trading Group. Each of these student groups reflect my passions for soccer, trading, and traveling.

      <p><b>Engineering Teaching Assistant: </b>Teaching Assistant for GEEN1400 (Engineering Projects) whose purpose is to provide students an introduction to engineering through a series of small projects done in interdisciplinary teams. Students learn in a hands-on way valuable engineering skills including communication skills, how to function in teams, the basic steps in engineering design process, and a variety of computer tools as appropriate to their projects, such as spreadsheets, dynamic modeling software, or computer-aided design (CAD).</p>
      <p><b>Engineering Tutor:</b> Helped tutor numerous students in various subjects including Data Structures, Calculus, and Introduction to Computing. Tutoring topics included data abstractions (e.g., stacks, queues, lists, trees, graphs), representation techniques (e.g., linking, arrays), definite integrals, methods of integration, improper integrals, Taylor's theorem, and infinite series. </p>

            <p><b>Overview</b></p>
            <p>Taking inspiration from NASA's Apollo Moon landings 50 years ago, the Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone (GLEE) will be a catalyst for a new generation of space missions and explorers. This scientific and technological mission to the Moon will deploy 500 LunaSats to the lunar surface to conduct local and distributed research by partnering with NASA’s 2023 Artemis Mission to the Moon. LunaSats are tiny spacecraft with an integrated sensor suite that will be programmed by teams of students, from every member country of the United Nations, to a mission of their own design. These teams will be mentored by GLEE program staff through the entire design, build, test, launch, and data gathering process.</p>
            <p><b>Technical Applications</b></p>
            <p>Working within an agile team setting, Software Engineers within GLEE lead the development of embedded software, analysis, and a library which enables students to write their own LunaSat scripts. </p>
            <p>This includes LunaSat code documentation, verification and validation, and the development and testing of a delay-tolerant LoRA wireless network architecture. This also involves dynamically scaling sampling protocol with associated data relay, aggregation, and presentation. Furthermore, we implement software for a wide variety of sensors including Magnetometer, Accelerometer, Capacitive, Thermopile, and Radio Frequency Sensors that will be included in the final LunaSat Architecture.</p>

            <p><b>Overview</b></p>
            <p>History Through Battleship is an educational web-game developed to test and refine students’ history skills. The application, which features both single player and local multiplayer, runs similarly to your typical battleship game. However, the game has a fresh educational twist that is meant to offer practical use. When launching a missile, a user must successfully answer a trivia question or risk losing their turn.</p>
              <p><b>Technical Applications</b></p>
              <p>Within the single player game mode, the user plays against an intelligent AI system that can launch missiles based on previous hits/misses. This competitive system can be a hard match for even the smartest history buff. The local multiplayer mode is played between two users on the same system. Once player 1 has placed his/her ships, they pass their turn to player 2 who will do the same. When both players’ ships have been placed, they can start the game. The users will then alternate turns by clicking the “End Turn” button at the bottom of the screen.

              </p>
              <p>On the backend, History through Battleship utilizes a database to keep track of user’s usernames, passwords, and stats. This database is updated as new users register. Similarly, users stats are updated as trivia questions are answered correctly and incorrectly. Furthermore, History Through Battleship connects to the Trivia DB API and retrieves the trivia questions seen within the game. These questions could be changed to other subjects as well.</p>

            The “Robo Pig” is an electronic car that detects

            entertainment and motor skill enhancement in
            children. The device works by sending in
            signals of detection of certain objects and
            outputting specific information to the motors.
